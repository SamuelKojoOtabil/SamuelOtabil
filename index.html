								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="image of Samuel Otabil" /></span>
								<p>I am Samuel Kojo Otabil, an aspiring architect deeply passionate about the intersection of art and design. My journey has led me to explore and refine my skills in various creative fields, including music, photography, and architecture. Driven by a meticulous attention to detail, I have also delved into model making and product design.
									<br><br> 
								I believe that true elegance and sophistication in architecture and design emerge from a keen attention to detail and a thoughtful approach. This philosophy guides my work and shapes my exploration within the field.
